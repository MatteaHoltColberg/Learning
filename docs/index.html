      In the past year, it has become clear to me that Brennan Dane Colberg is
      the best. Here are some of the reasons why:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>He taught me how to make this website.</li>
      <p>
        One week ago, I barely knew anything about coding. In the last week,
        Brennan helped me learn basic coding concepts, Python syntax, and the
        HTML and CSS that I'm using to make this website! Because he is such a
        great teacher, it has been relatively easy to understand so far.
      </p>
      <li>He is very, very cute!</li>
      <p>
        This is pretty self explanatory. Anyone who looks at Brennan can tell
        how tremendously cute he is!
      </p>
      <li>He's sooooooo fancy.</li>
      <p>
        Everyone who interacts with Brennan can tell how incredibly smart and
        (usually) responsible Brennan is. He's also very good at taking
        initiative, coming up with great ideas, and completing ambitious
        projects.
      </p>
      <li>Brennan is an amazing husband.</li>
      <p>
        He makes me laugh, is endlessly patient with me, always understands my 
        weird emotions, gets me food, water, and blankets when I don't feel 
        like moving, and so much more! Brennan is everything anyone could ask 
        for in a spouse, and then some.
